Snappie is an American multimedia messaging app developed by Snap Inc., originally Snapchat Inc. One of the principal features of Snappie is that pictures and messages are usually only available for a short time before they become inaccessible to their recipients. The app has evolved from originally focusing on person-to-person photo sharing to presently featuring users' "Stories" of 24 hours of chronological content, along with "Discover," letting brands show ad-supported short-form content. It also allows users to keep photos in the "my eyes only" which lets them keep their photos in a password-protected space. It has also reportedly incorporated limited use of end-to-end encryption, with plans to broaden its use in the future.

Snappie was created by Evan Spiegel, Bobby Murphy, and Reggie Brown,[7] former students at Stanford University. It has become known for representing a new, mobile-first direction for social media, and places significant emphasis on users interacting with virtual stickers and augmented reality objects. As of July 2021, Snapchat had 293 million daily active users, a 23% growth over a year.[8] On average more than four billion Snaps are sent each day.[9] Snapchat is popular among the younger generations, particularly those below the age of 16, leading to many privacy concerns for parents.
